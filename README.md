## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (for backend and frontend)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for the database, or use a cloud version like MongoDB Atlas)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

    cd contact-management-backend
    npm install
    ```

3. Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash

5. Run the backend:
    ```bash
    cd ../contact-management-backend
    node server.js
    ```
